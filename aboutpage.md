#### About our Software:
Our application's primary use is to match employees to roles, while not assigning the employee the same role in close intervals. If your company has to schedule employees and rotate the roles of each employee, then this application is perfect for you! Just follow the link to Github and download the latest release of our application. After entering your employees and roles into the program, all you have to do is click generate schedule and the program will generate a schedule for you. After that it's as simple as loading up the program and clicking generate schedule everyday. This will save you hours of scheduling employees by hand and will save your company money!!!
