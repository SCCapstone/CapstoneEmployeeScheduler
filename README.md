## Testing
### Unit Tests
We are using a built-in unit test framework in Visual Studio. To set this up we had to make a unit test C# project and add our project as a Reference. Then we were able to make unit tests for our code. In order to run our tests in Visual Studio: Click Build -> Build Solution, then click View -> Test Explorer, then click Run All Tests in the test explorer.
